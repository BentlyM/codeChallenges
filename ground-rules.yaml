Some ground rules:
  1. modules should be self contained
    - everything to do with my module is in my module
    - little to no global variables
    - if a module manages more than one thing it should be split up to another method/function (single responsibility)
  2. separation of concerns
  - DRY code: Don't repeat Yourself
  - KISS: Keep it Simple Stupid
  - YAGNI: You Ain't Gonna Need It (don't over engineer)
  3. effect DOM/variable/property usage
    - if it looks reusable REUSE IT. (do not just create another call)
  4. no memory leaks
    - all events can be unbound
